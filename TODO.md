# TODO List

This project is still under active development. Some improvements that could be implemented:

- Implement real-time order book feed via Binance WebSocket API for more precise HFT signals.
- Expand `hft.py` with latency monitoring and faster execution helpers.
- Extend the options module with Greeks calculations and advanced portfolio management.
- Add deep reinforcement learning examples for adaptive strategies.
- Create visualizations of performance metrics and risk indicators.
- Write integration tests that cover the interaction between the C# bot and Python optimizer.

Contributions are welcome!
