# TODO List

This project is still under active development. The following tasks remain or could improve the bot:

- Integrate real-time order book feed from Binance into the trading engine for more precise HFT signals.
- Expand `hft.py` with latency monitoring and faster execution helpers.
- Link the `database` module with the C# bot to store trades and metrics persistently.
- Provide an optional Dash web panel with additional charts and API credential fields.
- Implement adaptive stop-loss and take-profit using ATR.
- Support extended TradingView webhook fields and multi-strategy execution.
- Regularly cache fundamental data for transaction filters.
- Send Telegram alerts for executed trades and optimizer changes.
- Add deep reinforcement learning examples for adaptive strategies.
- Create visualizations of performance metrics and risk indicators.
- Write integration tests that cover the interaction between the C# bot and Python optimizer.
- Add a paper-trading mode and multi-exchange support.

Contributions are welcome!
